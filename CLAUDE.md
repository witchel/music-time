## Project History

This project maintains a `HISTORY.md` file — a human-readable narrative
of significant problems, breakthroughs, and design decisions. After
resolving any substantial change (new features, bug fixes, data pipeline
changes, visualization experiments), consider whether it warrants a new
entry or an update to an existing one. The history captures the *why*
behind decisions, not just the *what*.
